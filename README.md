Guess the Number game

An interactive application of the Guess the Number game. 

Note: this program is designed to run in the CodeSkulptor online terminal (www.codeskulptor.org) - the module simplegui will not run in base Python, therefore the code will not run as is. However, this module can be downloaded locally here: https://florian-berger.de/en/software/simplegui/
